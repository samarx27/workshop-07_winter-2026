Week 7 workshop: linear models

This is a README! It tells you what is in the GitHub repo.

All READMEs for this class should have the following sections:

What is this repo for?
This repository contains one example for running a linear model.

Whose repo is it? Who is contributing to it?
this is my personal repo forked from the envs-193ds-2026 organization. I am the sole contributor 

What files are there?
all code files are in the code folder, these are .qmd files that contain models for abalone-pH ('abalone-example.qmd'). 

What code is there, and what does it do?
the files include code for creating linear models, checking model diagnostics, creating predictions and visualizing predictions. 

Link to the rendered output. Make sure it is a **working url**. You can test this by sharing the url with someone else to open on their computer - if it doesn't work, that means your GitHub pages set up didn't work.
